Coursera Developing Data Products
The files ui.R and server.R are shiny server ui files that have been created for the final project of the developing data products course (Coursera). The UI is an activity calculator which takes the users age and heart rate (beats per minute) as input and returns either: "Light", "Fat Burning" or "Cardio" as an indicator of the level of activity.
